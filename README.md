# Passwordgenerator Project
<br>
Getting Started
<br>
I began by creating the html skeleton and the adding a css style sheet to style the project. I also used Bootstrap to creat a grid that contains the main display of the project. For the javaScript, I create a main function that will run when the user click the "Generate Password Button." The fuction runs the alert questions and then an if statement that runs a for loop based on the users input. the results of the for loop are saved into an empty password variable. Using the dom, I created a function that saves the displayed password to the clipboard when the copy button is clicked. 
<br>
Function :
<br>
The application generates a random and secure password based on user input.
